the fulton county grand jury said friday an investigation of atlanta's recent primary election produced `` no evidence '' that any irregularities took place .
the jury further said in term-end presentments that the city executive committee , which had over-all charge of the election , `` deserves the praise and thanks of the city of atlanta '' for the manner in which the election was conducted .
the september-october term jury had been charged by fulton superior court judge durwood pye to investigate reports of possible `` irregularities '' in the hard-fought primary which was won by mayor-nominate ivan allen jr. .
`` only a relative handful of such reports was received '' , the jury said , `` considering the widespread interest in the election , the number of voters and the size of this city '' .
the jury said it did find that many of georgia's registration and election laws `` are outmoded or inadequate and often ambiguous '' .
it recommended that fulton legislators act `` to have these laws studied and revised to the end of modernizing and improving them '' .
the grand jury commented on a number of other topics , among them the atlanta and fulton county purchasing departments which it said `` are well operated and follow generally accepted practices which inure to the best interest of both governments '' .
merger proposed 
however , the jury said it believes `` these two offices should be combined to achieve greater efficiency and reduce the cost of administration '' .
the city purchasing department , the jury said , `` is lacking in experienced clerical personnel as a result of city personnel policies '' .
