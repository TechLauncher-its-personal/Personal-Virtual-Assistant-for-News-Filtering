## Reporting a Vulnerability

If the vulnerability has low priority and is not directly exploitable (such as missing defensive code), please open an issue, and use the label `security`.
For all other vulnerabilities, please send an email to thingpedia-admins@lists.stanford.edu and include the word "security" in the subject.
Please include the affected version, any details to reproduce the problem, and whether an exploit is possible.

We strive to triage all vulnerabilities promptly, and you should receive an update with a timeline shortly after your report.
If the vulnerability is confirmed, it will receive a CVE identifier as soon as it is issued.
Vulnerabilities in the `production` branch will be given additional priority.
